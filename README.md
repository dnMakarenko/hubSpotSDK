# hubSpotSDK
hubSpotSDK is a SDK tool for hubspot.com

To test it, you need to build solution and run hubSpot.Client console app.
You can also use it as a class librery.
In future i think we'll need Test Project to test this sdk. But there are only two methods:) 

P.S 
Before you start testing, please see App.config and change settings to your own.
If you haven't account on hubSpot.com you can use my settings from the box.
